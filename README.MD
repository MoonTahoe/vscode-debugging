# Debugging a Basic Node File

Node js is easily debugged, you can simply run the debugger. If you want, you can also setup a `launch.json`. This file tells the debugger how to work when it is launched. In the current example, the value for `console` has been set to `integratedTerminal` which allows us to debug `process.stdin` input from the console.
